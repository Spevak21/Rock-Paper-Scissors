# Rock-Paper-Scissors
My first project in form of a game Rock-Paper-Scissors

I have used MVC (Model-View-Controller) approach for the first time for separation of JavaScript code. I am amazed with how much control it has over scopes and how less bug encounters I got once I started using it.

## Game description

Standard rock-paper-scissors game where a player can play against PC or another player.
All rules are explained in the 'rules' section of the application.
